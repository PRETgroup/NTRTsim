 * @brief Contains the definition of class tgUnidirectionalCompressionSpringActuator.
 * This class assumes a linear spring, F = k \delta x - bV, where the spring begins to
 * apply a force when the length between anchors goes down past restLength.
 * Uses a tgBulletUnidirectionalCompressionSpring to calculate and apply forces.

 * This class is what should be used to create a compression spring in NTRT.

 * in the hopes that this functionality will be added.
 * Since it uses a tgBulletUnidirectionalCompressionSpring, the force applied
 * is only along one direction, not the full 3D vector of distance between nodes.
 * E.g., if direction is (0, 1, 0), then the applied force is always in the vertical
 * direction, and is proportional to only the vertical distance between nodes.
