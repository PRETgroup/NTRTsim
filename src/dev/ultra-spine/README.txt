This folder contains mostly outdated models. Use the 'laika' folder for all work relating to the quadruped robot that's built using the spine.

However - this folder does contain a few useful applications for the spine itself.

VerticalSpine - used for the distributed control work on the spine, with the vertical model.
SpineKinematicsTest - shows a spine suspended in the air, used to measure the path of the spine vertebrae during bending. This app is to be used for the paper that proves feet-stay-on-the-ground-during-bending, as a way to say "look our robot bends kind of like a constant-radius curve.'

TO-DO: archive and delete the overlapping/deprecated stuff here.
