# This is the "passive" vertebra for the Laika prototype for the IROS 2018
# submission, in cm.

# Centered at the local origin.
# nodes are now re-named, as looked at from the robot's right side (right and left
# are as if I was the robot, standing on my hands and knees), with top and bottom
# as on the robot's back and stomach, and left-right on its sides.
# In comparison to the MATLAB script, here, we need to have vertical position
# be the second parameter.
# NOTE that "X" is positive to the left, ugh. We're switching that so that the "X"
# axis points to the right, like normal people. All X switched from matlab calcs.
# ALSO, "Y" positive goes "backward/into the page", not towards the viewer. So, we
# also switch the right/left from the MATLAB calculations.
