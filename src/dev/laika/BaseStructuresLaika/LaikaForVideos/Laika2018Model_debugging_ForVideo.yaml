# YAML file that uses the 2018 model for Laika, but for taking videos.
# based off the 2018IROS_cm model.

# These calculations place the origin as in-between the two feet at the robot's rear.

# We're going to assemble with the rear two feet across the origin,
# so move the rear's origin (attachment for t1) up by the leg's vertical amount,
# and "forward" (-X) by the leg attachment point.

# NOTE: The vertical displacement is leg height plus the 1.5 offset of the ground
# (ground is not at origin.) So, that's 19.35 + 1.5 = 19.35

# TO-DO: switch around the labelling of foot ABCD, since Y has to be switched
# same as +/- X. E.g, front-right foot is actually at -x, -y.

# We need to have a massless tetrahedron for t1 so the hips stay at zero density
# when auto-compounded.
