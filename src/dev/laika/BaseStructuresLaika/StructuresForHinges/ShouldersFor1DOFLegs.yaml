# Units are currently in cm
# These shoulders are just one box.
# NOTE that these can be used for both legs on one end, but need to use a
# different file for the shoulders and for the hips.
# That's because we couldn't differentiate between which shoulder/hips otherwise
# when applying the btHingeConstraint.
# Procedure for hinged legs: create a btHingeConstraint between the center point
# 	    of one of the hipsBack rods. This can be the same constraint for
#	    both legs, since it doesn't really matter the distance between
#	    the rigid bodies. We'll be "applying a torque" between each leg
#	    and the center of the hips, but that should be OK... right?
