# Units are currently in cm
# This file defines one leg, as a "stick."
# It will be one long box with a ball at its foot,
# like the legs on the current Laika.
# We need to name the legs differently so we can add the hinges correctly
# to each of them. Legs are the same modulo their names.

nodes:
  # Second vertex is the endpoint. 
  # Seemed to be about 30 units down.
  # But, to visualize this by itself, put the start of the leg "up".
