# A combined set of hips and legs for the rear of Laika.
# This is just stick legs with balls at the bottom.

# Where things go:
# The tetrahedron connection point is at the origin
# Leg connection points are at [+cd, 0, +/-ld]
# (connection distance, leg distance, Drew's names.)
# Leg origin is at [0, -length, 0]
# So, let's move the legs down, to keep vertebra connection at origin.

# ...don't need the below, since auto-compounding works when nodes intersect.
# let's bond the legs to the hips.

# need to make a little rod to connect the leg to the hip
