# Units are currently in cm
# These shoulders are just one box.
# NOTE that these can be used for both legs on one end, just rotated.
# Drew thinks of these as cd (connection dist) and ld (leg dist) for the T-shape/.

nodes:
  # first two are the base connection for the shoulders
  V1: [0, 0, 0]   
  V2: [-15, 0, 0]
  # second two are the two endpoints of the "T"
  V3: [-15, 0, 15]
  V4: [-15, 0, -15]

pair_groups:
  # The base part of the shoulders will be a box

  # The back part of the shoulders will be rods
