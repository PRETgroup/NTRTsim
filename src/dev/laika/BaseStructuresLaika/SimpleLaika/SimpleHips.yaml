# Units are currently in cm
# These hips are just one box.
# NOTE that these can be used for both legs on one end, just rotated.
# Drew thinks of these as cd (connection dist) and ld (leg dist) for the T-shape/.

nodes:
  # first two are the base connection for the hips
  V1: [0, 0, 0]   
  V2: [15, 0, 0]
  # second two are the two endpoints of the "T"
  V3: [15, 0, 15]
  V4: [15, 0, -15]

pair_groups:
  # The base part of the hips will be a box
  hipsBase:
    - [V1, V2]
  # The back part of the hips will be rods
