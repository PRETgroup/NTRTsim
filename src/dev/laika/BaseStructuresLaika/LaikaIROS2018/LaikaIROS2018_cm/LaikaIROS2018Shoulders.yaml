# Two boxes that will connect the legs to the vertebrae. (Shoulders.)
# We'll do it as a "T" shape.
# Center of shoulders at origin.
# For shoulders, all directions are -X.

  # connecting each of the two legs.
  # This will be the shoulders, so leg A will be the front right, D left.
  # displacement left/right is 17.6/2 - (leg width/2), 7.55
