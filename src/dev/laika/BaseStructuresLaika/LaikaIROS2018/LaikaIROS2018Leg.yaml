# This YAML file has two parts:
# (1) Leg box, single leg, local frame is at top of leg
# (2) foot, which is a "sphere" approxed in place of a "rod" since it's easier
# to align the nodes that way.

nodes:
  # First vertex is at origin, allows for easy attachment to hips.
  legtop: [0, 0, 0]
  # no translation in X or "Z", perfectly in the "Y" plane.
  # Legs are 22.1cm from top to full bottom, so we need to subtract
  # away half the top height (to align the legtop node with the hips)
  # and the foot radius (to align legboxend with foot.)
  # 22.1 - (6/2) - 1.25
  legboxend: [0, -0.1785, 0]
  # Instead of a rod, put a sphere with the same radius, at legboxend.

  legBox:
    - [legtop, legboxend]

builders:
  # Let's do the box for the leg.
  # It's 0.3 cm thick (in X) and 2.5 cm wide (in Y.)
  # On 3/1/18: when factoring in new mass of cables, desity from 299 to 425
  # ...also adding friction.
  legBox:
    class: tgBoxInfo
    parameters:
      density: 0.0 # From matlab calculations, 299
      width: 0.003
      height: 0.0125
  # Also need a sphere. Created according to node names, not groups.
  # Need to set friction down to zero so the robot moves smoothly.
  legboxend:
    class: tgSphereInfo
    parameters:
      density: 425 # From matlab calculations, 299
      radius: 0.0125
      friction: 0.0 # for IROS 2018, choose 0.5.
      roll_friction: 0.0 # for IROS 2018, choose 0.5.
