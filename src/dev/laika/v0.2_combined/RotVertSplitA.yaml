# NOTE that as of 2018-02-10, the vertebrae are now centered at the origin,
# NOT at some z-displacement!!!

nodes:

# Below is a symmetric version of this tetrahedron,
# with an extra small node for a "rod" that will serve
# as the axis for a hinged joint.
# Renamed to put "A" so that we can differentiate between the two
# vertebrae in the rotating joint.
# To-Do: remove the two legs that aren't used: from the working YAML model,
# the TetrahedralSpineWithRotJoint, it looks like front/backA are used, and
# only left/rightB are used.
