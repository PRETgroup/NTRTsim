# This is the final version of Laika
# that will be used for the IROS 2018 data.
# We use the 'cm' version, and translate it
# so that it's centered in the camera.
# Total length of the robot is 'front' translation plus 'front' length,
# which would be -52.201 -12.6 -1.25 (for the foot.)
# = -66.051, half = 33.0255

# We're going to use the SI model for data collection,
# and the centimeters model for good video.
# The SI units model starts with the 'rear' at the -x (e.g., towards
# the right) at the distance away of the leg center node.
# So, in the App, need to make sure the CD feet at at 0 x translation.

# Use the "IROS" model for the original submission's data,
# and the "ICRA" model for the corrected simulation.
