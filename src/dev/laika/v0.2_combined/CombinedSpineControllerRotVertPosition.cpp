  // First, increment the accumulator variable.

    // Calculate and apply a torque that will be controlled around a position

    // We want to obtain the rotation around the axis that aligns rod A and rod B.
    // Luckily enough, we already know that the frame will be aligned along the
    // X-axis, since that's how we've set up the btHingConstraint.
    // So, we can take advantage of quaternions here:
    // a quaternion is (axis + angle), so just taking the angle of the quaternion
    // that represents this A-to-B rotation will give us what we want.

    // Here's the procedure that is used in this code.
    // We'll use rotation matrices first.
    // 1) Get the rotation matrix of each of the two frames (rod A, rod B), with
    //    respect to the world
    // 2) Get the net rotation from one frame to another
    // 2) Get the angle along the axis that connects these two frames (which, if R is going from A to B, just the rotation implied in R around R's unit vector.)
    // (note, we *know* that the unit vector u of R_net will really only have one component, along the x-direction, since we've constrainted along the other two.
    // 3) Calculate the difference between this angle, and the t_set
    // 4) Calculate and apply a torque proportional to t_diff (the control.)
    
    // Much credit to the wikipedia article on rotations:
    // https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#Rotation_matrix_from_axis_and_angle
    // As well as some comments on coordinate systems from stackexchange:
    // https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/1870661/find-angle-between-two-coordinate-systems  
    
    // OK, so one way to get the net rotation matrix between the two is to
    // first rotate A back to the origin, then apply the rotation to get from
    // the origin to B. Since we have R_a_origin, and R_b_origin, given by the basis
    // for the transformation for both rigid body objects, this could be:
    btTransform rodaTransform = hingedRodA->getPRigidBody()->getWorldTransform();
    btTransform rodbTransform = hingedRodB->getPRigidBody()->getWorldTransform();
    // We can get the rotation matrices from each transform
    // (note that we want to ignore the translation!)
    btMatrix3x3 rodaWorldRotation = rodaTransform.getBasis();
    btMatrix3x3 rodbWorldRotation = rodbTransform.getBasis();
    // ...we might have been able to just use quaternions here, but this made more
    // sense to Drew at the time.
    // To get the net, invert the rod A transform, then apply the B transform.
    // Using Bullet's methods, we can say:
    btMatrix3x3 netRotation = rodaWorldRotation.inverse() * rodbWorldRotation;
    // The order doesn't matter here, just off by a +/-, since the only difference
    // when "looking" from one rod to another is the direction of the unit vector.

    // Next, let's get the quaternion for this net rotation, and extract its angle.
    btQuaternion netRotQuat;
    netRotation.getRotation(netRotQuat);
    btScalar netRotScalar = netRotQuat.getAngle();
    // for checking: let's get the axis here too. Should be only in one direction.
    //btVector3 netRotAxis = netRotQuat.getAxis();
    //DEBUGGING
    //std::cout << "netRotScalar: " << netRotScalar << std::endl;
    //std::cout << "netRotAxis: " << netRotAxis << std::endl;
    // GREAT THIS SEEMS TO WORK. netRotAxis is roughly (1, 0, 0),
    // and netRotScalar is some reasonable value.
    
    // Great. Let's perform the control.
    // First, a control constant. The angle seems to be in the range of
    // like 0.00 to 0.03 radians, for our purposes. And the torque to apply
    // is on the order of 0.2. So maybe a K of 5 or 10?
    double K_P = 1000; // 50 worked, but lots of overshoot

    // Calculate the new torque we want to apply, - K * (x - x_ref)
    // we've arbitrarily choosen torques to be negative?
    // The error between the current and desired, x - x_ref, is
    double error = netRotScalar - m_setAngle;
    // Let's do an integral term also.
    m_accumulatedError = m_accumulatedError + error;
    // a really small constant here works best.
    double K_I = 0.5;
    // Combined control input is:
    double controlInput = - (K_P * error) - (K_I * m_accumulatedError);
    
    // As a torque vector, along the x-axis:
    btVector3 controlledTorque( controlInput, 0, 0);
    //DEBUGGING: what's the error that we're controlling around?
    // Need to develop a control such that this trends to zero.
    std::cout << "error: " << error << std::endl;
    // it would be interesting to plot this.
    // torque, aligned with the world, referenced against rod A.
    // (choice is arbitrary, since we can just do +/- switching A to B.)
    btVector3 worldControlledTorque = rodaWorldRotation * controlledTorque;
    // ...apply the torque, opposite to each body.
    hingedRodA->getPRigidBody()->applyTorqueImpulse( worldControlledTorque );
    hingedRodB->getPRigidBody()->applyTorqueImpulse( -worldControlledTorque );
    // this worked. With just P control, seems to have steady-state error.
    // With I control, seems to track down to machine precision.
    // TO-DO: SEEMS TO ONLY USE FLOATS, NOT DOUBLES? We've only got 7 digits
    // of precision and not 14...
