# This is the moving, Y-shaped vertebra from the 2D spine control hardware test.

# Centered at the center of mass (supposedly, need to check), where the center node
# is at the origin. This is NOT the frame in MATLAB that was used in Dec. 2018. 

# Notes on dimensions:
# "X" is positive to the left, ugh. We're using NTRT's frame for ease but the visualization looks backwards.
# The second coordinate vertical - but be careful of handedness issues.
# ALSO, "Y" positive goes "backward/into the page", not towards the viewer. So, we
# also switch the right/left from the MATLAB calculations.

# Taken directly from the MATLAB script.
