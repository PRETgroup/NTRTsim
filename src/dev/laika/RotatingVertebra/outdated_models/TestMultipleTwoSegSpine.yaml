# Test YAML structure to see if connecting substructures by their nodes
# will also create connections internal to the substructure.
# Answer: it appears that, NO, that does not happen.
# For example, here, the right <-> center cable ONLY happens
# between the "outer" vertebrae of TwoSegSpine, not BETWEEN
# the two vertebrae in one TwoSegSpine.
