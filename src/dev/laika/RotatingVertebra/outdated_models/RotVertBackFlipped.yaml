# This YAML file flips the back rotating vertebra.

# The front and back parts of the vertebra:
substructures:
  flipped:
    path: ./RotVertBack.yaml
    rotation:
      axis: [0, 0, 1]
      angle: 180

  #front:
  #  path: ./RotVertFront.yaml
  #  translation: [-10, 20, 0] # only a small translation need, so no collisions.

# This single vertebra does not have any cables, so that's it.
